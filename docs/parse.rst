Parse the Results
=================

HYDRAD prints all results to the ``Results`` directory in the main code
directory. These filenames are in the format ``profile{index}.{ext}``
where ``index`` is the timestep number and ``ext`` can be one of the
following filetypes,

-  ``phy`` – main physics results file containing temperature, density,
   etc.
-  ``amr`` – data related to the adapative mesh
-  ``trm`` – equation terms at each grid cell

Parsing all of these files can be difficult. ``pydrad`` provides a
convenient object, ``Strand``, for easily accessing the data associated
with a particular HYDRAD run. To create a ``Strand`` object,

.. code:: python

   >>> from pydrad.parse import Strand
   >>> s = Strand('/path/to/hydrad_dir')
   >>> s.time # simulation time array

The ``Strand`` object can be indexed to get the sets of results at a
particular timestep,

.. code:: python

   >>> s[0]
   >>> s[100]

which returns a ```Profile`` <api/parse.md>`__ object. The resulting
``Profile`` object has attributes for getting at the hydrodynamic
quantities,

.. code:: python

   >>> p = s[0]
   >>> p.electron_temperature
   >>> p.ion_density
   >>> p.velocity

See the `API for the ``parse`` subpackage <api/parse.md>`__ for a list
of all available attributes.
